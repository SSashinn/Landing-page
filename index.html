                    In 1191, Altaïr and two fellow Assassins—brothers Malik and Kadar Al-Sayf
                    are sent to Solomon's Temple to retrieve an artifact known as the Apple of Eden from the 
                    Brotherhood's sworn enemies, the Knights Templar. Blinded by arrogance, Altaïr botches the mission,
                    resulting in Kadar's death; however, Malik is able to grab the Apple before escaping. 
                    Although Altaïr later partially redeems himself by fighting off a Templar attack on 
                    the Assassin home base of Masyaf, his mentor and superior, Al Mualim, 
                    demotes and orders him to assassinate nine individuals in order to regain his previous
                    position and honour.

                    By 1476, Ezio has grown into a charismatic but reckless young man. After his father 
                    Giovanni and brothers Federico and Petruccio are framed for treason and executed by 
                    corrupt magistrate Uberto Alberti, Ezio retrieves his father's Assassin equipment and 
                    murders Uberto in revenge. Ezio and his remaining family—his mother Maria and sister Claudia 
                    flee Florence and head to their ancestral home in Monteriggioni. There, Ezio's uncle 
                    Mario explains their family's role as members of the Assassin Brotherhood, and reveals
                    that Giovanni was killed because he had uncovered a conspiracy masterminded by the Templar Order,
                    the Assassins' sworn enemies.

                        In 1506, during his pursuit of Cesare Borgia, Ezio visits his friend, Leonardo da Vinci,
                        at his workshop in Rome to ask for his help in securing a ship to take him to Spain. Leonardo offers 
                        to take Ezio to meet a friendly ship captain, but before that, he asks that Ezio go 
                        find his apprentice, Salaì. When the two return to the workshop after a run-in with 
                        Hermeticists, members of the Cult of Hermes, they find it abandoned, and deduce that 
                        Leonardo was kidnapped by the Hermeticists, who forced him to take them to an 
                        underground temple he had found. Salaì finds writing on the floor that implies they 
                        should seek out five of Leonardo's paintings once owned by Ezio at Monteriggioni but 
                        now missing.

                        Ezio and Sofia return to Masyaf, where Ezio unlocks Altaïr's library, finding it empty
                        except for Altaïr's skeleton and a sixth key. Through the key, Ezio discovers that the 
                        library was a vault meant to house Altaïr's Apple of Eden and that Altaïr had sealed 
                        himself to protect it. Ezio leaves the Apple there, stating that he had seen enough for 
                        one life, and speaks directly to Desmond, knowing that he is watching. He tells Desmond 
                        that he realizes he is nothing more than a conduit for a message, and hopes that Desmond 
                        will be able to find answers to his questions. With this, Ezio retires from the Assassins.
